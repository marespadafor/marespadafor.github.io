## Espadafor, M & Kreiman, G. Can State-Building Decisions Equalize the Playing Field in the Aftermath of Civil War? Evidence from Perú


What is the impact of civil war dynamics on educational outcomes? 
Previous evidence consistently shows the negative impact of civil war and wartime exposure on educational outcomes. This has been at the expense of neglecting one of the core dynamics in post-conflict scenarios: the expansion of state reach to wartime affected areas. 
In this paper, we argue that the expansion of state capacity, through increased access to primary and secondary education, can lead to potential improvements in the educational levels of people living in conflict affected areas, which ultimately reduce war-time inequalities. 
We test these arguments focusing on the Peruvian Civil War (1980-1992).First, we leverage novel census data (1961-2017) to analyse whether districts that were either contested or controlled by the insurgent group, Sendero Luminoso, had lower levels of educational outcomes right after the conflict. Then, using a Difference in Differences design, we test whether war-time inequalities are compensated through an expansion of state reach to these areas. We expect that those communities contested or under insurgent control (war-time areas) had lower levels of educational access and attainment than those controlled by the state. We expect these inequalities to decrease or disappear by state building initiatives, such as the provision of public schools. Our study aims to challenge existent evidence on the relation between civil war dynamics and civil war showing how the dynamics of state expansion could end up with some of the most pervasive inequalities developed by internal armed conflicts.
