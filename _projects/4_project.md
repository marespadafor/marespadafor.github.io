## Espadafor, M. & Bernardi, F. The uneven risk and effect of grade retention across family origins.

This chapter focuses on the uneven effect of a remediation policy within the educational system: grade retention. We study the transition from Compulsory Education to higher secondary education in Spain, where retaking is relatively high. We investigate whether retaking a grade during compulsory education reduces the probability of remaining in the education system and whether the effect of retaking on school continuation decisions differs by family socioeconomic status. We leverage differences in regional educational laws to use an Instrumental Variable design that accounts for selection bias in educational transition models. Results show that (1) high-SES families are able to moderate the risk of falling into grade retention, but that (2) increases the chances of dropping out for all. However, (3) its effect is substantially more detrimental for children from low socioeconomic status. Finally, we show that na√Øve models that do not consider reverse causality and selection bias underestimate inter-generational transmission of educational inequalities. Results suggest that grade retention fails as a remediation policy and instead increases the inter-generational transmission of inequalities in education.
