## Gil-Hernández, C.J., & Espadafor, M. An Elephant in the (Class)room? Teacher’s Bias in Grading and Track Recommendations by Student’s family SES

Teachers are the gatekeepers and evaluators of academic merit in educational systems. The literature shows teachers’ bias in assessments as a function of students’ ascribed characteristics such as gender, ethnicity or socioeconomic status. Nevertheless, most previous research overlooks the role of teachers as relevant actors in the early stages of the status attainment process, suffers from methodological flaws, and focuses on gender or ethnicity. 
This article provides new evidence on teachers’ bias as a mechanism of intergenerational educational reproduction. We ask whether family SES has a residual effect on teachers’ grades and track recommendations, net of student cognitive and non-cognitive skills and if the teacher’s bias is the greatest among low-performing students. We further discuss the findings’ theoretical and normative implications for inequality of educational opportunity. 
We answer these questions using data from the German National Educational Panel Study and study a cohort of students during primary education. Most previous research measured teacher bias as the difference between teachers’ grades and blindly assessed standardised test scores at a snapshot across schools. This approach might reflect biases by measurement error, students exerting less effort in low-stakes testing and different grading standards across schools. We address these methodological flaws by examining extensive cognitive and non-cognitive measures throughout elementary education and controlling for school-fixed effects. Furthermore, we account for any remaining students’ unobserved characteristics by implementing an instrumental variable design, leveraging exogenous variation in tests-scores from different domains. 
Results show that teachers perceive high-SES students more favourably. They assign a 15% standard deviation higher GPA in maths and German to high-SES and give up to 10% more recommendations to secondary academic schools (Gymnasiums) to high-SES students than to their equally skilled low-SES schoolmates. Furthermore, teachers’ bias toward students’ family SES in grading and track recommendations is the largest among low-cognitive performers.
