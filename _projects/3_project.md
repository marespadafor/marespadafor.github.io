## Espadafor, M. Are boys more vulnerable to family disadvantage? Evidence from the United Kingdom.

There is a growing literature showing the importance of family socioeconomic status (SES) for explaining the male disadvantage in education. However, when and through which channel these gaps emerge remains unclear. This article examines whether and when family SES moderates gender differences in several educational outcomes. 
Focusing on the timing and the domain of the gender-SES gaps, this article contributes to the literature by testing the relative importance of birth characteristics, academic skills and values for explaining the gender-SES gap in education. To test these channels, I use the Millennium Cohort Study and focus on children's trajectories from birth to age seventeen.
Results suggest that girls and boys within each level of family SES start with equal health at birth and cognitive abilities throughout schooling. In contrast, high-SES families are able to moderate and compensate for the higher incidence of boys externalising behaviours and school detachment as gender identities become more salient at school.
