I am a quantitative sociologist and policy analyst from AlmerÃ­a (Spain), one of the [sunniest cities](https://weather-and-climate.com/average-monthly-hours-Sunshine,almeria-andalucia-es,Spain) in Europe. I work at the intersection of inequality research and strategic foresight. Currently, I serve as a **Senior Policy Analyst at the National Office for Foresight and Strategy** in the Presidency of the Government of Spain. There, I coordinate projects on the future of education, work, and demographic change, utilising research to inform long-term strategies that promote more inclusive and sustainable societies. You can check the work of the Office [here](https://futuros.gob.es/en/our-work).

Before joining the public sector, I completed a **PhD in Social and Political Science** at the **European University Institute (EUI)**, where I specialised in social stratification and causal inference methods. I have held positions as a **Postdoctoral Researcher** in the Horizon Europe project [MapIneq](https://mapineq.eu/), as an **INVEST Fellow** at the University of Turku, and as a **Visiting Scholar** at the Centre for Demography and Ecology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

At the core of my professional and research agenda is a simple but urgent question: **How can we reduce inequality through research and policy?** I try to answer this question by combining rigorous empirical work with hands-on policy engagement. While I focus in particular on **educational and labour market inequalities**, I am also interested in how broader institutional arrangementsâ€”such as welfare systems, state-building, or reproductive rightsâ€”shape inequality across generations. My work has been published in journals like [*European Sociological Review*](https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcaf003), [*Population & Environment*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11111-025-00477-8), or [*PLOS One*](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0258857), and I regularly teach causal inference in international methods schools such as [RECSM at UPF](https://www.upf.edu/web/recsm) and [TNSQUARE in Trento](https://tnsquareunitn.github.io/).

If you work on similar topicsâ€”or if you're curious about what strategic foresight looks like from inside governmentâ€”feel free to get in touch!

Previously, I was a **Postdoctoral Researcher at UNED** in the Horizon Europe project [MapIneq](https://mapineq.eu/), and a visiting fellow at the **University of Turku** and the **University of Wisconsin-Madison**. I hold a PhD in Sociology from the European University Institute (EUI), where I specialised in social stratification and causal inference methods.

Much of my work focuses on **educational and labour market inequalities**, especially how these evolve across generations and respond to policy interventions. Iâ€™ve published in journals like *European Sociological Review*, *Population & Environment* and *PLOS One*, and taught causal inference in international summer schools such as [RECSM at UPF](https://www.upf.edu/web/recsm) and [TNSQUARE in Trento](https://tnsquareunitn.github.io/).

Alongside research, I enjoy working across institutions. At the Foresight Office, Iâ€™ve led contributions to national strategies like **HispanIA2040**, collaborated with the **OECD**, the **European Commission**, and other ministries, and promoted the use of evidence for future-proof policymaking.

I also have a keen interest on policy analysis. I'm a Junior Fellow of Future Policy Lab (FPL), a recently-created think tank whose aim is to shape the public debate in Spain on some of the most pressing issues of our time. My research has been featured in [elDiario.es](https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/abrir-casas-apuestas-cerca-institutos-baja-rendimiento-escolar-barrios-humildes_1_8440297.html), [Cadena SER](https://cadenaser.com/ser/2021/10/31/sociedad/1635675473_674477.html), and [RTVE](https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20211107/casas-apuestas-proximidad-colegios-barrios/2211660.shtml), in Spain.
