I am a quantitative sociologist and policy analyst from Almería (Spain), one of the [sunniest cities](https://weather-and-climate.com/average-monthly-hours-Sunshine,almeria-andalucia-es,Spain) in Europe. I work at the intersection of inequality research and strategic foresight. Currently, I serve as a **Senior Policy Analyst at the National Office for Foresight and Strategy** in the Presidency of the Government of Spain. There, I coordinate projects on the future of education, work, and demographic change, utilising research to inform long-term strategies that promote more inclusive and sustainable societies. You can check the work of the Office [here](https://futuros.gob.es/en/our-work).

Before joining the public sector, I completed a **PhD in Social and Political Science** at the **European University Institute (EUI)**, where I specialised in social stratification and causal inference methods. I have held positions as a **Postdoctoral Researcher** in the Horizon Europe project [MapIneq](https://mapineq.eu/), as an **INVEST Fellow** at the University of Turku, and as a **Visiting Scholar** at the Centre for Demography and Ecology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

At the core of my professional and research agenda is a simple but urgent question: **How can we reduce inequality through research and policy?** I try to answer this question by combining rigorous empirical work with hands-on policy engagement. While I focus in particular on **educational and labour market inequalities**, I am also interested in how broader institutional arrangements—such as welfare systems, state-building, or reproductive rights—shape inequality across generations. My work has been published in journals like [*European Sociological Review*](https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcaf003), [*Population & Environment*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11111-025-00477-8), or [*PLOS One*](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0258857), and I regularly teach causal inference in international methods schools such as [RECSM at UPF](https://www.upf.edu/web/recsm) and [TNSQUARE in Trento](https://tnsquareunitn.github.io/).
