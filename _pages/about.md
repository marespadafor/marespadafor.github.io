I am a quantitative sociologist from Almer√≠a (Spain), one of the [sunniest cities](https://weather-and-climate.com/average-monthly-hours-Sunshine,almeria-andalucia-es,Spain) in Europe. I got my PhD at the European University Institute (Florence) and now I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at UNED (Madrid) working in the Horizon Europe project [MapIneq](https://mapineq.eu/).

I am broadly interested in inequalities: how these are transmitted through generations or through different institutional configurations. In my research I use quantitative methods and (aim for) causal inference designs. 

Given my interdisciplinary background, I am also interested in how historical and contemporary states and the rule of law can shape or produce (if any) inequalities. For example, I am developing a project which looks at the consequences of women's reproductive rights, and other which explores the impact of state building decisions in the aftermath of a civil conflict.

I also have a keen interest on policy analysis. I'm a Junior Fellow of Future Policy Lab (FPL), a recently-created think tank whose aim is to shape the public debate in Spain on some of the most pressing issues of our time. My research has been featured in [elDiario.es](https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/abrir-casas-apuestas-cerca-institutos-baja-rendimiento-escolar-barrios-humildes_1_8440297.html), [Cadena SER](https://cadenaser.com/ser/2021/10/31/sociedad/1635675473_674477.html), and [RTVE](https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20211107/casas-apuestas-proximidad-colegios-barrios/2211660.shtml), in Spain.
