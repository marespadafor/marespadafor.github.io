### The ABCs of Regression Discontinuity 

This course is designed for researchers with a basic understanding of quantitative analysis but
willing to deepen into the various statistical and econometric techniques related to causal
inference analysis. By the end of the course researchers will be able to:
1. understand and critically engage with terminology and concepts behind causal
identification.
2. understand and perform causal inference designs in Stata or R.
3. critically assess checks and threats of causal inference designs

### [Drawing Maps in R](https://github.com/marespadafor/drawingmaps)

This is an introductory course on spatial data I taught within the CLIC Training workshops as part of the GEOSMITE Project at the European University Institute in 2020.

 Lab’s Goals
- Introduce researchers to basic GIS concepts and how to read traditional GIS shapefiles in R
- Introduce researchers to the map outlines available in the maps package
- Show how to convert those data into data frames that ggplot2 can deal with
- Use ggmap and ggplot2 to make some pretty maps
- Discuss some ggplot2 related issues about plotting
- Using sp to plot maps with different projections
- Bonus: calculate distances and applications
